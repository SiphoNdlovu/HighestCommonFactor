The project calculates the hcf from a given array , using the euclidean algorithm

Used the euclidean algorithm to calculate the  hcf. Given an element is s 0, the fuunction returns 1. No libraries were used.

To test , change the values in the list : int[] elementsToFindHCF = {8,16,20,30}; (found in the main class and method).
